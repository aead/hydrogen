## Sodium
Sodium is a new, easy-to-use software library for encryption, decryption, signatures, password hashing and more.

This project provides an API-compatible and idiomatic Go implementation of the famous C library [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium). The goal is to provide an easy-to-use, flexible and performant crypto library and make strong cryptography as simple to use as possible.

Therefore sodium relies on few but well-designed and approved cryptographic primitives like [ChaCha20Poly1305](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7539) and [BLAKE2b](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7693). For further details check out the [documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/aead/sodium).
