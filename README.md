## Hydrogen
Hydrogen is a Go implementation of the [libhydrogen](https://github.com/jedisct1/libhydrogen) library.

This project tries to provide an idiomatic and easy-to-use / hard-to-misuse API to modern cryptographic primitives.  
Therefore hydrogen relies on few but well-designed and approved cryptographic primitives like BLAKE2X,  
XChaCha20 and X25519. For more information take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/aead/hydrogen/wiki) or the [documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/aead/hydrogen).

### Quick start
To get the latest version run: `go get github.com/aead/hydrogen`  

For more information about how to use hydrogen within your project take a look at the **Installation** section.
